## next.js App Router API conventions

### What is the App Router?

The App Router in Next.js is a system that helps you define and manage the routes (URLs) in your application. It uses a file-based routing system, which means the structure of your files and folders determines the routes in your app.

### Basic Structure

In Next.js, you create an app directory at the root of your project. Inside this directory, you organize your routes using folders and files.

app/
├── dashboard/
│ ├── layout.js
│ └── page.js
└── settings/
├── layout.js
└── page.js

In this example:

The dashboard folder represents the /dashboard route.
The settings folder represents the /settings route.
Each folder contains a layout.js file for the common layout and a page.js file for the specific page content.

Next.js does not use export default function handler() for API routes. Instead, it follows a different convention.

### API conventions

You can handle different HTTP methods by exporting functions named after the methods (e.g., GET, POST):

// app/api/user/route.js
export async function GET(request)
export async function POST(request)

## Spline import in client side component error explaination

Server-Side vs Client-Side:

In Next.js 13+, Server Components are designed to handle asynchronous operations like async/await, fetching data, etc. These components are rendered on the server and sent to the client.
Client Components, on the other hand, are rendered on the client side. They are used for handling interactive, user-facing UI features (such as events, animations, or dynamic states). async/await is not supported directly in Client Components because the client needs a synchronous interface to ensure smooth UI rendering.
What Happens with Spline?

Spline uses asynchronous operations to load and render 3D models, which typically involves fetching model files (like .spline files) from a server or some external resource.
When you attempt to use async/await in a Client Component to load the Spline model, Next.js tries to execute this operation on the client-side. However, since asynchronous operations aren't allowed directly in Client Components (without special handling), it triggers the error you're seeing.

## mouse event properties

The e.clientX and e.clientY properties are part of the MouseEvent interface in JavaScript, which represents an event generated by a mouse action, such as a click, mouse movement, or mouse drag.

### e.clientX and e.clientY

    - e.clientX: Represents the horizontal (X) coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the viewport (the visible part of the browser window), excluding any scroll offset. It gives the position of the mouse pointer on the X-axis.

    - e.clientY: Represents the vertical (Y) coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the viewport, similar to clientX, but on the Y-axis.

## e.target instanceof HTMLElement &&

This checks if the target of the mouse event (e.target) is an instance of HTMLElement.
e.target refers to the specific HTML element that triggered the onMouseDown event (i.e., the element the user clicked on).
This ensures that the code only operates when the click is on a valid HTML element, not something else like a text node.
e.target.closest(".spline-container"):

## e.target.closest(".spline-container")

The .closest() method searches for the closest ancestor element (including the target itself) that matches the given CSS selector (.spline-container).
If e.target or any of its parent elements has the spline-container class, .closest() will return the first matching element, otherwise null.
So, if the click happens inside the .spline-container (which wraps the Spline character), this condition will be true.
